# ES6 pwa

This is a template for a Vanilla JavaScript ES6 static PWA with modules, hosted on GitHub Pages

## How ?

Everything is made in house. No library. No framework.  
Nothing.  
Not even Bootstrap. You don't need Bootstrap. Just learn CSS â™¥

## Why ?

Vanilla HTML, vanilla CSS, vanilla JS, the point here is no **compilation**, no **versioning problems**, no **framework specific synthax** to learn.  
Basically a POC, not gonna lie.

### Also

Everything is here and customizable.  
You don't like the way I handle my CSS ? Just change it, it's right there.
